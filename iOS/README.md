<hr>

Here you will find a library to help when you want to start a project using beagle for iOS.
These libs will facilitate the initial Beagle configuration in a project, avoiding some
steps, and starting studies quicker.

* If you wish to use Beagle for an application in production we advise you to configure a project
 from scratch using our
 [documentation](http://docs-beta.usebeagle.io/home/get-started/creating-a-project-from-scratch/case-ios/)

### Getting started
<hr>

To start using Beagle right now, you can use the libs below:
* [Beagle-Scaffold](https://docs.usebeagle.io/get-started/using-beagle-helpers/ios/beagle-scaffold/):
This lib will hold almost all configurations needed to start using Beagle in your project.
We advise using these libs for people that never used Beagle before.

* [Beagle-Defaults](https://docs.usebeagle.io/get-started/using-beagle-helpers/ios/beagle-defaults/):
This lib is meant for more experienced Beagle users and will hold only a few class configurations necessary to use Beagle in an application. These configurations include default Network, Logger and Cache classes. All these are also available in the Scaffold lib above.
